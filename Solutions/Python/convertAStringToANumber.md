## Problem

We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?

Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.

**First Solution:**
```python
def string_to_number(s):
  return int(s);
```
