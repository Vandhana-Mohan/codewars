## Problem

Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.

For example, the score of abad is 8 (1 + 2 + 1 + 4).

You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.

If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.

All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.

**Solution 1:**

```python
def high(x):
    alphabet = {'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'e': 5, 'd': 4, 'g': 7, 'f': 6, 'i': 9, 'h': 8, 'k': 11, 'j': 10, 'm': 13, 'l': 12, 'o': 15, 'n': 14, 'q': 17, 'p': 16, 's': 19, 'r': 18, 'u': 21, 't': 20, 'w': 23, 'v': 22, 'y': 25, 'x': 24, 'z': 26}
    words = x.split()
    values = {}
    for word in words:
        worth = 0
        for letter in word:
            worth += alphabet[letter]
        values[word] = worth
    return max(values, key=values.get)
```
