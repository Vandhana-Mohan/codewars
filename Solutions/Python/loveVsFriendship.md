## Problem

Ifã€€a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 ... z = 26

Then l + o + v + e = 54

and f + r + i + e + n + d + s + h + i + p = 108

So friendship is twice stronger than love :-)

The input will always be in lowercase and never be empty.



**First Solution:**
```python
def words_to_marks(s):
  s = list(s.lower());
  total = 0;
  alphabet = {"a" : 1, "b" : 2, "c" : 3, "d" : 4, "e" : 5, "f" : 6, "g" : 7, "h" : 8, "i" : 9, "j" : 10, "k" : 11, "l" : 12, "m" : 13, "n" : 14, "o" : 15, "p" : 16, "q" : 17, "r" : 18, "s" : 19, "t" : 20, "u" : 21, "v" : 22, "w" : 23, "x" : 24, "y" : 25, "z" : 26}
  print(s);
  for letter in s:
    total += alphabet.get(letter);
  return total;
```
